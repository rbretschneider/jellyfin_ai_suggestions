Plugin to search for something to watch using google gemini.

Results will display whether they are in library or not, and allow adding to playlist or viewing / searching.

I spent a long time trying to get this to a public page anyone can use not just admins, but it seems jellyfin plugins are not designed that way.
Feel free to PR etc use at your own will.
